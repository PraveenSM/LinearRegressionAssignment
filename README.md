## General Information
- This project meant for assignment which build the model for target variable rental count for bike rental firm.
- Objective is to build the model to predict which variable have most impact and how much.
- As part tof this project all MLR concepts are used.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model is built with R-Square around ~84
- Identified the most impactful variables
- Covered and used all needed concepts
- All the conlusions were tested on the data set and proved thar model is best fit.


## Technologies Used
- Statsmodel, sklearn, pandas, numpy libraries
- Concepts of MLR such as RSS, R-square, P-value
- Python notebook is used to evaluate and build the model
